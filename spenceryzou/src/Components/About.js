                        Hi there, I'm Spencer! I'm a second year UC Santa Barbara Computer Science student from the Bay Area.
                        I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction, particulary developing media, interfaces, and graphics that serve
                        to change a user's perception and intuition through design cues. I'm currently searching for
                        internships for Summer 2020! If you or someone you know is interested, check out this fancy sheet of paper: <a style={{fontStyle: "italic"}} target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cBK1KNmMv8Ypru8Uj5dLXweS0iUCLxeY/view?usp=sharing">résumé</a>
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        In my free time, I like to read fashion blogs, play soccer (big Manchester City fan), drink boba, and sing!

                        I'm interested in roles such as UI/UX Engineering, Web Development, Software Development, 
                        or anywhere that I can be involved in creating a product! {
